I learned the art and diligent process model of retained exective search during the 1990's  at Bishop Partners as Susan Bishop taught me the right way to do retained search - the value added process model she taught was refined at Starpoint Executive Search and is now now being applied to add value and bring creativity with excellence in execution of senior management retained searches.  Combined with my revenue and organizational building expertise, with real hands on experience as a CEO/COO of venture funded early and mid stage companies, this creates a powerful background for doing excellent executive search work.\n\nIf you are looking for business leaders to help your company scale to the next level, I can think of nobody in the retained search field who brings more direct hands on experience than  my partner Mike Sullivan and I.  We have the experience and resources needed to do great search.
